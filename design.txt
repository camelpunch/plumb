Pipeline
--------
Enqueues everything into the waiting queue, in roughly reverse order.


Waiting queue runner
--------------------
do I have siblings?
  no: move to immediate build queue
  yes:
    have all of my siblings passed?
      yes: move to immediate build queue
      no: leave in queue


There is one immediate build queue (per architecture), anything in it should be
run immediately.

Process single build in immediate build queue
--------------------------------------------
run script
  did I pass?
    no: notify of failure
    yes:
      store into builds that have passed
      did previous build for this job fail?
        yes: notify of success


build schema:
  - pipeline ID
  - job ID
  - pipeline run ID
  - sibling build IDs
  - commit SHAs
  - start time
  - end time
  - success boolean
